### The Start ###
To start this project, I began with prepping the site with several pages labeled according to the things needed for the project. I then started on the main page called "index.html" and finished a rough version of that with no errors so that I could later paste that into each page as a template. Then I took the css for index and supplemented it with a second .css for each page. 


### The building ###
I started working on previous and projects next, and they would be similar pages with different work in each. This was the most simple, since they both used lists and covered both styles, ordered and unordered. In the previous work page, I used unordered lists as it didn't make sense for a resume to be numbered. So I sorted three main lists, nesting a second list in each for formatting and started to work on page layout for said pages. I decided to use a grid system here since flex didn't feel as useful to get the double column into single column format that I wanted. Using grids, I made my first two lists normal, while the last list spanned both columns so that it wouldn't oddly squished in smaller media sizes. For projects, I used ordered lists instead and flex displays to get the side to side placement of each list since I didn't need a complex layout. 

Then contact was where I needed to use JS so that it would properly output the data. I didn't want it to be anything crazy, but
