### The Start ###
To start this project, I began with prepping the site with several pages labeled according to the things needed for the project. I then started on the main page called "index.html" and finished a rough version of that with no errors so that I could later paste that into each page as a template. Then I took the css for index and supplemented it with a second .css for each page. 


### The building ###
I started working on previous and projects next, and they would be similar pages with different work in each.
